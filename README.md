# Octohoodie App: Beach Poncho E-commerce Display

This project is a basic Create React App (CRA) designed to showcase an e-commerce product display for "Octohoodie" beach ponchos. It serves as a fundamental example of building a simple product catalog UI with React, featuring a hero section, product listings with "Sale" badges, and pricing information. The application leverages Bootstrap for styling and responsiveness.

## üåü Features

* **Product Showcase:** Displays a collection of "Octohoodie" beach ponchos with different colors.
* **Hero Section:** Features a welcoming message and a call-to-action button ("Shop Now").
* **Product Cards:** Each product has a "Sale" badge, a product image, a "Spring Special" label, and pricing.
* **Static Content:** The product information and pricing are currently static, serving as a display example.
* **React Framework:** Built using React, demonstrating component-based architecture for UI development.
* **Bootstrap Integration:** Utilizes `bootstrap` and `react-bootstrap` for responsive design and pre-styled UI components, ensuring a modern look and feel.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

**For this project to work, you must have Node.js installed on your system.**

If you don't have Node.js installed, please visit the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) to download and install it. You can verify your installation by opening your terminal or command prompt and typing `node -v` and `npm -v`.

**Once Node.js is installed, follow these steps:**

1.  **Clone or Download the Project:**
    Obtain the project files and navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal. This directory should contain the `package.json` file.

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all the necessary project dependencies, including React, React DOM, React Scripts, and Bootstrap packages.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    (Alternatively, if you use Yarn: `yarn install`)

3.  **Start the Development Server:**
    Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the React development server.
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    (Or `yarn start`)

    This command will open the application in your default web browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

* **`npm start`**
    Runs the app in the development mode.\
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

    The page will reload if you make edits.\
    You will also see any lint errors in the console.

* **`npm test`**
    Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
    See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

* **`npm run build`**
    Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
    It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

    The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
    Your app is ready to be deployed!

    See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

* **`npm run eject`**
    **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

    If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them.

    You don‚Äôt have to use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature.
